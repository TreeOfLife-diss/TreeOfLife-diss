_Code for Tree of Life - Dependency Installer for Scientific Software_

**Tree-of-Life** is a _stand-alone_ **library** written in [Python](www.python.org) that was designed to facilitate the installation of the dependencies required by **scientific software** which end users are mostly *non-developers* and to whom complex *terminal* operations may not be trivial. ToL reduces the task of installation and updating to simple *double-click* operations. Additionally, it provides a user-friendly interface to operate the installation process.
